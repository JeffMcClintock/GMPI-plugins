# Saw Demo Synth (adapted from the CLAP Saw Demo - Copyright (c) 2021, Paul Walker)

The Saw Demo Synth serves as an example in the following ways

- It binds a GMPI-Drawing UI to a plugin without using any frameworks
- It shows MIDI 2.0 support
- It sounds pretty good, with a Saw from the algorithm in Surge's Modern oscillator
  and an SVF filter from cytomic
- It is released under the MIT license

While some folks might actually want to use this as a synth, it really does serve
as a pedagogical exercise more than anything else.
